# Text Parser

That python program is made to analyze a .txt file and tell you the letters and words frequency. This script will allow a powerful optimization of a keyboard layout and at the same time a better understanding of our languages and use of keyboards.

Example of application : 

You're a French native but you also chat a lot in English and code in JavaScript, so you drop a .txt file into the programm with 40% of French, 40% of JavaScript code and 20% of English. By using this script you will have the required metrics to build or edit your perfect keyboard layout (and even a keyboard map probably).
