# Text Parser

This script is built to generate a pdf report based on the statistics analysis of one to three sources.
Its scope is the frequency of letters (and words soon).

To use this program you first have to download it :

## Download

```
git clone https://github.com/Constantin-Hentgen/Text-Parser.git
```

## Launch

```
python3 src/Main.py
```

You will probably be asked to install some libraries such as Matplotlib, fpdf and numpy if you don’t have those installed on your system yet. If the previous commands didn’t work, make sure to execute those at the root of the project.

Here are some extracts of a report :
